These YAML documents are sourced from fssim/fssim_gazebo/models/track/tracks_yaml.

They are parsed by Gazilla. You should be able to make your own too. Unfortunately, I'm not sure
how these maps were generated in the first place (possibly manually?), but if we end up making
our own, I'll write an editor for it.
